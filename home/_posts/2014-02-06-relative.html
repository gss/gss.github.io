Notice how you naturally would describe the nearby layout of iOS devices:

<blockquote>
"Horizontally center the devices, & the bottom of the iPhone &amp; iPad should be equal."
</blockquote>

GSS stays true to our intentions:

{% highlight css %}

#iphone[center-x] == #ipad[center-x];
#iphone[bottom] == #ipad[bottom];

{% endhighlight %}
